## Overview
A Simple Tool for Examining Fixations (ASTEF) is a project for facilitating the use of spatial statistics on eye tracking data. The first version of the software was developed in C# and it is no longer maintained. This version is coded for Matlab. The interface has completely redesigned and simplified.

## Fixation Data Format
Fixation file has to be a text file with .txt.

First line: screen width and height, in pixel.

Second line: *"Timestamp Fix_x Fix_y"*.

From third line to the end: timestamp x y

Data is separated by white spaces.

Example:
```
1024 768
Timestamp Fix_x Fix_y
1083 369 482
1684 388 546
1856 359 589
2264 337 684
3212 340 854
3576 380 433
```
