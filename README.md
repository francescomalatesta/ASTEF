Francesco Di Nocera, Simon Mastrangelo, Claudio Capobianco, LAFC 2015

Official website: http://theskinnerbox.net/astef/

## Overview
ASTEF is a tool for ocular fixations visualization and analysis. In particular, this tool computes and plots the NNI (Nearest Neighbor Index).
## Fixation Data Format
Fixation file has to be a text file with .txt.

First line: screen width and height, in pixel.

Second line: *"Timestamp Fix_x Fix_y"*.

From third line to the end: timestamp x y

Data is separated by white spaces.

Example:
```
1024 1024
Timestamp Fix_x Fix_y
1083 369 482
1684 388 546
1856 359 589
2264 337 684
3212 340 854
3576 380 433
```
